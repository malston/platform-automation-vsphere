In collaboration with the login server, TEST can authenticate users with their PWS credentials, and can act as an SSO service using those, or other, credentials.\n\nTEST has endpoints for managing user accounts and for registering OAuth2 clients, as well as various other management functions.\n\nDifferent runtimes and services use separate TEST instances. PWS has two TEST instances by default: one for BOSH Director, used to bootstrap the rest of the PWS deployment; and one for the BOSH deployment, used as a shared resource by all apps that require user authentication. This is the minimum number of TEST instances PWS must have. Other runtimes and services also have TEST instances. These instances are separate from each other. If you log into one runtime or service, you are not also logged into other runtimes and services that authenticate using TEST. You must log into each runtime or service separately.\n\nFor more details on TEST metrics, visit https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-6/uaa/uaa-metrics.html",
